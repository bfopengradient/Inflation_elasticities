### Inflation elasticities.

Checking rolling log-log regression models. The target variable is inflation. The predictors are one period lags of the unemployment rate and short term interest rates.

The elasticities are the coefficients from a log-log regression model, i.e where logs are taken of both the predictor and the target variable. 

In this repository there is a py file containing all the variables and accompanying functions for the els class. There is also a jupyter notebook that utilises the els class to produce charts of the elasticities, the p-values of the elasticities and the R2's.
